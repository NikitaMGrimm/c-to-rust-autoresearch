# Rule catalogue

Every translation rule the research loop adds or changes has an entry here, so
the results can be traced to rules. The loop gate rejects a change to `src/`
that leaves this file unchanged.

Entry format, newest last:

```markdown
## R1: short name

- C: the construct it translates, for example `printf` with a literal format
- Rust: what it emits for it
- Motivation: the development programs that failed without it, and how
- Changes: earlier rules it replaces or extends, if any
```

No rules yet.
