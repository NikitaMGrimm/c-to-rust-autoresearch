# c-to-rust-autoresearch

Bachelor thesis: improving a mechanical C-to-Rust translator through an LLM-driven research loop.

The transpiler starts empty; translation rules are added by the research loop.

## Setup

Linux only. Needs [rustup](https://rustup.rs) and, on Ubuntu 24.04:

```sh
sudo apt install clang-18 clang-tidy-18 libclang-rt-18-dev llvm-18 jq
```

`rust-toolchain.toml` pins the Rust version, and the transpiler always calls
`clang-18`, so results stay comparable between runs.

## Use

```sh
cargo run -p transpiler -- input.c -o output.rs
scripts/inspect input.c      # declarations, Clang warnings, clang-tidy, sanitizer run
scripts/inspect output.rs    # rustc and Clippy warnings, unsafe code, rustfmt, run
```

`scripts/inspect` passes further arguments to the program and exits 1 when a
tool reports an error.

Benchmarks are not published yet; keep local ones in the ignored `local/`
directory.
